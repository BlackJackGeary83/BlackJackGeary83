Did you feel it ? As soon as your web browser finished loading my profile, a wind of chad-air blew into your face !


You just arrived on the most chad profile on this website, so , without further ado, allow me to introduce myself ! 


I'm a Chad Linux user, VIM addict and Github god.


I like to program stuff between my sets at the gym.

 
I pray to god 7 times a day and never miss an office at church, in fact, my only dream is to retake Jerusalem from Sarracens.
